       "'I love Nicholas Sparks. I&#8217;ve read everything he&#8217;s written and couldn&#8217;t wait for my copy of Safe Haven to arrive.Safe Haven had a different feel than many of Nicholas Sparks books. It was much less sappy than most of his books. Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230; I love sappy but this book was much deeper than many of his other books. It explored life in an abusive relationship and the struggle to escape and start over.I felt a connection to the characters and never lost interest in the story. The audio narration was well done. The only thing that annoyed me was the whiny voice the narrator used for 5 year old Kristen. Fortunately she didn&#8217;t have many lines in the book.This book played out in a predictable manner. Although one thing I have learned from reading Nicholas Sparks is that sometimes he is not predictable and he goes for the heart-break ending. This book did have an unpredictable element to the ending but thankfully it was a touching unpredictable and not a heart-breaking unpredictable.Content: Just a couple of swear words. One of the characters in this book is psycho, I mean seriously crazy. We hear his demented crazy thought process and the details of some of the things he does are described. There are scenes of physical abuse described and a few sex scenes that aren&#8217;t overly graphic but are lewd. Although I can&#8217;t classify this book as clean it wasn&#8217;t nearly as graphic as it could have been. It was well written and I would recommend it to adults who have read this content warning.Rating: 4 Stars. I made it through this book in less than 2 days. Some great writing from Nicholas Sparks.Source: I received an audio version of this book from Hachette.'"

      "Winter's Past by Mary E. Hanks is a contemporary Christian novel that speaks of God's redemption and forgiveness in marriage.Winter Cowan is a Christian speaker and the head of Passion's Prayer, a group of like-minded individuals travelling across the country sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, they are going to  Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and there is one person there she does not want to see - her ex-husband.Ty Williams is a changed man and he is determined that Winter knows it. While he realizes he was the cause of their break-up, he is trusting God to make Winter see that he is a changed man - one who believes in God now. He is determined to win her back and re-marry &#34;the wife of his youth.&#34; Now all he has to do is get Winter to forgive him. But will Winter practice what she preaches? Can she ever really trust or forgive Ty for cheating on her?And that is the crux of this story right there. Winter preaches about God's forgiveness, so now she basically has to practice it or be a hypocrite. The author has done a good job of creating the horror that Winter experienced when she was faced with the infidelity of her spouse. And she does an equally good job of showing the angst that comes with practising what all Christians preach - forgiveness.It's not so easy to forgive when you lose your trust in the one you have pledged your life to. Which is why I hope this book will touch a chord with Christians who  seem to be taking a page from the world these days and divorcing as often as Hollywood stars. It is a touchy subject, but the author has done a very good job of fleshing it out.My only problem with this book would be that everyone seems to be Christian. For example, when asking to put flyers up in a restaurant, the owner (who was Christian) encouraged Jeremy (the one putting up the flyers) to tell everyone about Jesus. And of course everyone in the restaurant was very appreciative of that. As much as I wish that would happen in real life - it wouldn't. So that seemed a bit contrived. In addition, the Pastor who moons like a puppy-dog the moment he sees Winter doesn't seem plausible either. It was in fact uncomfortable to read and made the Pastor come off as a sappy kind of teenager, which I'm sure the author did not intend. If she chose to ever rewrite her book I would suggest she work on those two areas.Despite that however, the book is one that I would encourage you to read as it speaks of love, redemption and forgiveness in a big way and I believe would be an encouragement for Christian couples who are contemplating divorce. I give Winter's Past 4/5 stars.\n",
